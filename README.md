5. On the next screen set the amount of **RAM** and the number of **CPUs** you want to use.
   * If you have at least 8GB of RAM on your host computer, setting the RAM to 2048MB works pretty well.

8. Go to the **Advanced** tab and set both the dropdowns next to **Shared Clipboard** and **Drag ‘n Drop** to **Bidirectional**.
   * Shared clipboard allows you to copy/paste between your host computer and the virtual machine.
   * Drag ‘n Drop allows you to drag/drop files between your host computer and the virtual machine.

9. Select **Network** from the left menu.
   * The first network adapter is already enabled and set to NAT. It connects to our home internet. You need to enable a second network adapter that will connect to our internal VirtualBox network.

<h3>Part 4: Install and Set Up Windows Server 2022 on the DC Virtual Machine</h3>

1. Double click the DC virtual machine, and it will start in a new window that appears.
   * Once it has loaded a box will appear that says your virtual machine failed to boot. This is because you have not installed the actual operating system yet.
2. Click the dropdown arrow in the box next to DVD and navigate to the folder where you downloaded the Windows Server 2022 ISO.
3. Select the Windows Server 2022 ISO file, and click Mount and Retry Boot to restart your virtual machine.
4. Once your VM restarts, the Windows installation tool will appear. Click Next and Install now.
5. On the next screen select Windows Server 2022 Standard Evaluation (Desktop Experience) and click Next.
   * If you select an option that does not say ‘Desktop Experience’ you won’t have a GUI.
6. Click the checkbox next to I accept the license terms and click Next.
7. Select Custom: Install Windows only (advanced) since this is the first time you are installing Windows on this machine.
8. Click Next and the tool will install Windows 10 on your machine.
   * During installation your virtual machine will restart several times. You will see a black screen that says ‘Press any key to boot from CD or DVD’. Just do not press any buttons until your machine has booted into Windows.
9. Once your virtual machine has booted into Windows you will need to set a password for your Administrator account.
   * Your password can be anything but I just use something simple like ‘Password1’ if you are just using it for a lab environment.
10. Once you are at the Windows lock screen, select Input from the top menu of your VM, and select the keyboard to see the keystroke you need to press to unlock your machine. 
11. Select Insert Ctrl-Alt-Delete or press the keystroke you see next to it to unlock your machine.
12. Enter the password you created for the Administrator account to log in to your Windows Server.
